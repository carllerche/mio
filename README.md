# MIO - Metal IO

MIO is a lightweight IO library for Rust with a focus on adding as
little overhead as possible over the OS abstractions.

**API documentation**

* [master](http://rustdoc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mio/master/mio/)
* [v0.4](http://rustdoc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mio/v0.4.x/mio/)
* [v0.3](http://rustdoc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mio/v0.3.x/mio/)

## Usage

To use `mio`, first add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
mio = "0.3.0"
```

Then, add this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate mio;
```

## Features

* Event loop backed by epoll, kqueue.
* Zero allocations at runtime
* Non-blocking TCP, UDP and Unix domain sockets
* High performance timer system
* Thread safe message channel for cross thread communication

__Eventually__

* Signal handling
* Windows support

## Non goals

The following are specifically omitted from MIO and are left to the user
or higher level libraries.

* File operations
* Thread pools / multi-threaded event loop

## Platforms

Currently, MIO only supports Linux and Darwin. The goal is to support
all platforms that support Rust and the readiness IO model.
